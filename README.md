AlertMe is basically a social media website dedicated to sharing news within particular cities. It has features that mordern social media websites (like instagram, etc.) have.


About the project:

1. It asks users to enter their city/village name while registering (signing-up) for the website along with some basic personal details, and takes them to the homepage of all the posts that are made within that city. If the user uploads a news post, it'll be posted in only the particular city which they may have selected while regitering.

2. The website is supervised by admin(s) to make sure that no other content except a particular city's news is posted on the website. Users can report inaprropriate contents if they find any.

3. Users can subscribe to channels, get notified (alerted) about the news posts of their subscriptions, get notified about comments, search for channels, view their/other channel's profile page, get verified (✔), see who has subscribed to their/others's channel, see which channels a channel has subscribed to, edit profile (edit password, profile picture and city): users can change the city if they want, this would take them to the homepage of the city they have changed to and each post made by them would be considered unique for that city. Users can only search channels which reside in the current city they have logged-in to.

4. Users can like/dislike a post, comment on it, see who have liked/disliked/commented on a post, etc..

5. Admins can block users, login as a user, verify(✔) accounts, view website analytics.

6. OTP verification is present for registration and for changing passwords.

7. AlertMe is supposed to be a dedicated platform for all the residents of particular cities/villages who share news.

Note: The database file for this project is named as "cpe.sql" because this was a final year project made by my team in our diploma in Computer engineering, which our institute had named "Capstone project execution", thus "cpe".
